# 16 | Data Journalism and D3

## Background

Scatter plot to demonstrate health risks facing particular demographics, with data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

### Tasks Include:

Find a correlation between two data variables, each measured state by state and taken from different data sources. Then visualize the correlation with a scatter plot and embed the graphic into an .html file. The data is one-year estimates in 2014 from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey by using the [American FactFinder](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml) tool, and the data on health risks using 2014 survey data from the [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/BRFSS-2014-Overall/5ra3-ixqq). 

Using the D3 techniques to create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. Code this graphic in the `app.js` file.

Embed `d3.html` in `index.html` with an iframe. Add a written analysis of the data below the graphs.

The incorporate d3-tip to display data with each state (circle) when user hovers cusor over the elemen. 

Last but not least, dynamic D3 to enable resizing the graphs for mobile users.
