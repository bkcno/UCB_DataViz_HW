# HW 16 | Assignment 

## Background

Scatter plot to demonstrate health risks facing particular demographics, with data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

## Tasks

### Level 1: D3 

Find a correlation between two data variables, each measured state by state and taken from different data sources. Then visualize the correlation with a scatter plot and embed the graphic into an .html file by accomplishing the following four steps:

#### 1. Find the Data

The 2014 one-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey by using the [American FactFinder](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml) tool, and the data on health risks using 2014 survey data from the [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/BRFSS-2014-Overall/5ra3-ixqq). 

#### 2. Format and Test the Data

Format data for D3. With two data types chosen, grab the value columns from each and paste them into a new Excel document. Create header names that you can easily call with JavaScript (concise, lowercased, camelCased). Make sure that rows and columns line up.

#### 3. Visualize the Data

Using the D3 techniques to create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. Code this graphic in the `app.js` file.

#### 4. Embed into an iframe

Embed `d3.html` in `index.html` with an iframe. Add a written analysis of the data below the graphic.


### Level 2: Presentation

#### 1. More Data, More Dynamics

#### 2. Incorporate d3-tip
