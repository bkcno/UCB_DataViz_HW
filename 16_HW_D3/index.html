						<h2>The Numbers Behind Healthcare Coverage</h2>
						<h3>Does Education Promote Health Awareness?</h3>
						<p>It is almost self explanatory that employement status impacts healthcare coverage. However, after analyzing various datasets from both <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml" target="_blank">American FactFinder</a> and 
							<a href="https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Behavioral-Risk-Factors/BRFSS-2014-Overall/5ra3-ixqq" target="_blank">Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System</a> comparing healthcare coverage, or lack thereof, against multiple variables, the results are not as simpl as it seems.
							When examing the year 2014 data across all 50 states, we have found that being employed full-time has negative 40% correlation with not having health insurance coverage, that is, being a full-time employee predicts having healthcare coverage
							with 40% accuracy. Poverty, on the other hand, has <b>55.66%</b> positive correlation with the absence of healthcare coverage. Interesting enough, the correlations between education levels and healthcare coverage are more significant than 
							these two factors. For the group with education of college or higher, the correlation with lack of healthcare is negative <b>56.92%</b>, whereas, for group with less than high school graduate education, the correlation with lack of healthcare is at <b>68.95%</b>!
							Hence, the finding here could enforce the argument that educational programs and policies are important public health instruments.
						<br>	
						<h3>The Road Ahead:</h3>
						<p>Not surprisingl, there is a positive <b>68.26%</b> correlation between lower education and poverty. Understanding the socialeconomical dynamic in between helps the general public to be better informed. The failure to provide social safety net to the struggling 
							or vulnerable population will be in the long run costly to the society as whole. </p>
